function [G0_Rh2O3_ls] = G0_Rh2O3_ls(T, P_tot, X_i, P_units)
%
%  each substance should have a function Go_substance_ls.m for condensed
%  phases, and Go_substance_gv.m for gas/vapor.  See FAQs below.  
% 
% this function gives the standard Gibbs energy Go of substance as function of T, Ptot, and mole fraction which for a gas or ideal solution is X_i=P_partial/P_tot
% T and Ptot can come in as vectors, so output in general will be a 2D array.  
% T in K, P in atm, Torr etc (must put in string argument 'atm' or 'Torr' etc)
% G computed in kJ/mol becasue tables are this way then we convert to eV/formula unit at the end
% Logical masks are used like step functions vs T, allowing the whole expression to be built up piecewise over the list of T values  
%
% for a gas/vapor or mechanical mixture of phases such as ideal solution, mu(T,Ptot,Xi) = {Go(T,Pref) from Showmate equation} + kBT[ln(Ptot/Pref) + ln(X_i)]
% the total Gibbs energy of a mixture is Gmixture = Sum(Xi*mu_i) . Note how you end up with the xlnx terms this way, giving the ideal entropy of mixing
%
% FAQ1: Yes, we need to keep the P dependence in the input arguments for condensed phases becasue it makes the output an array of the right size even if the columns are identical 
% 
% FAQ2: why not put all phases in 1 file (l, s, and gas)?  Splitting out the gas/vapor phases can allow us to use these same files to compute the equilibrium vapor pressure for specifying thermodynamic conditions and things like that, rather than just having
% these files only spit out mu values.  
%
% FAQ3: waht if there are multiple allotropes for condensed phases?  List their Showmate equations (including any P dependencies).  Calculate the Go for all
% of them.  Then at the end of the section, just pick the minimum value for each T,P_tot point - that automatically gives us the Go for the stable phase under those conditions.  
% A future improvement could be to also spit out an array telling which phase is stable where.  Could be done with T,P masking and a unique ID for each phase.
